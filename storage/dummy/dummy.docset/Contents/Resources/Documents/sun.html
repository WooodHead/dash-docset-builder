    <h1>Sun</h1>
    <p>It all started with a hangover.</p>
<p>I had met him the previous night. He's my brother, but not really. The thing is we have different parents. But still we chose each other over a decade ago.</p>
<p>I love him, but we can't meet too often. Something about my physical and emotional health. I have also lost a few clothes during our nights, or have woken up wearing garments that were not mine (and which usually belonged to the opposite sex). There were too many times.</p>
<p>I woke up with an unbearable headache that day and was in need for a strong coffee. I jumped into the first place I've found.</p>
<p>The outside wood panels held a sharp red, and it hurt my eyes so much that I had to squint painfully. The only thing I could do was push through the front door.</p>
<p>A mild step I didn't see stopped my left foot mid-air and I floored myself, flying the postcards stand in the process.</p>
<p>The place went silent, people stared at me. I stood up, brushed myself, closed my zipper, and head towards the cafe counter.</p>
<p>And there she was, beaming like the sun.</p>    <footer class="my-35 float-right">
