    <h1>Legacy</h1>
    <p>The truth is that most of those things didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get lost by your surroundings. You get absorbed. The big picture is getting blur. This is why traveling to a place far far away&mdash;both physically and emotionally&mdash;always results in a strong kick in the balls.</p>
<p>Eye opening. </p>
<p>Most of those things don&rsquo;t matter. </p>
<p>What matters is very little.</p>
<p>Human connections. Helping your neighbor. Leaving this place in a better state than when you arrived.</p>
<p>But maybe once you&rsquo;re gone things will get worse? What was your real impact? How useful were you? Maybe you weren&rsquo;t... Or maybe your legacy is all the connections you&rsquo;ve built, which will die soon enough too. </p>
<p>Maybe all of your life is actually just you being selfish.</p>
<p>But maybe if you&rsquo;ve touched people, and brighten their lives, and their lives is better and they are better people because of you, and you&rsquo;re dead, and you can&rsquo;t enjoy it, so where  <strong>really</strong> is the selfishness in that?</p>
<p>That is a question worth asking.</p>    <footer class="my-35 float-right">
