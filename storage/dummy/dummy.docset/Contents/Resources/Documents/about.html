            <h1>I'm bad with the past</h1>
<p>I have a hard time remembering the past. The truth is that my brain is small, I have no much memory, and I have no incentive to keep track of my previous work. What for? I can't see any valid reason. I learn from what I did, but I stop there. It's always a pain for me to write resumes, because I don't have any idea of what I did. So I don't write any.
I try a lot of different things, I work on a lot of different projects, but I don't keep track of what I have been doing. I know I have been painting, doing music, climbing rocks for months, I have been traveling for years, touring for live performances, read books for weeks without moving, learning languages, meeting people.
I do no try to keep a solid track. I just learn from the past, and use it in my present.</p>
<p>But I always try to take care of 4 area everyday: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual. This mindset crystallized after reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743226755/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fromoktogreat-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0743226755&amp;linkId=581770f9745c58b3b49a79191cf2b6bb">The Power of Full Engagement</a> by Tony Schwartz.</p>
<p>So apart from the projects listed, this is what I currently do everyday to take care of those 4 areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical</strong>: swimming, yoga, climbing, bodyweight exercises, cook whole food</li>
<li><strong>Mental</strong>: read psychology/philosophy, write everyday for <a href="http://fromoktogreat.com">From OK to Great</a>, <a href="http://sleeplessmind.info">sleeplessmind.info</a> or just myself, code</li>
<li><strong>Emotional</strong>: talk with friends, consciously read or watch things that are in "have to" list, cook, write, experiment new things</li>
<li><strong>Spiritual</strong>: meditate, be grateful for the luck I have had in life</li>
</ul>        </article>
